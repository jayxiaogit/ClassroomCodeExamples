This is a classwork project from Intermediate Programming. I was given template files and tasked to build a language model: 
The language model is based on word-level trigram frequency: how often ordered triples of words appear 
consecutively in a collection of example texts.

There were 4 different input commands that would prompt the program to perform operations:
a - output a list of all trigrams found in the training data, along with their frequency counts, 
ordered lexicographically by trigram in ascending order
d - output a list of all trigrams found in the training data, and their frequency counts, 
ordered lexicographically by trigram in descending order
c - output a list of trigrams found in the training data, and their frequency counts, ordered in decreasing order by count.
f - output the most frequently occuring third word given the first two words

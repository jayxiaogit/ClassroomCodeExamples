I used maps to hold the data for my code because I felt like that was the easiest way
I defined functions for handling each command so that I just had to call them in my main function,
as well as one additional function that created the map that every other function used in their implementation
to keep track of the trigrams and their counts, and I could iterate over it to print outputs.
One thing that I did that really helped me was concatenating the trigrams together to form one string
before I added them to the map
